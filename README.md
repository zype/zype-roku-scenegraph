The app is built upon the Roku Scene Graph API and Zype API.

- Video Search
- Live Stream, Video On-Demand and Playout videos
- Video Favorites
- Deep linking to videos and playlists
- Autoplay
- Subtitle Support (WebVTT, SRT)


## Monetizations Supported

- Pre-roll and Midroll (via [ad timings](https://support.zype.com/hc/en-us/articles/223153427-Ad-Timings)) Ads (VAST)
- Native SVOD via In-App Purchases
- Free to Watch

## Creating New App with the SDK
